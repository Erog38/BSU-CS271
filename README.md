## Building and Running

  From the directory containing these java files simply run the following command:
        $ javac *.java
  Then to run the program simply run the following command from the directory 
  containing Main.class file.
  	$ java Main

## Testing

  We have included a test file that tests all of our logical methods that verifies 
  login information for creating, editing, or deleting user. This test file contains
  multiple assert statement inside the same method for robust testing. GUI testing 
  is not implemented in this test class - it only test for logistics.
